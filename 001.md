# 1. How do you create and host a tiny (simple) website?

Starting out on this project it is easy to get bogged down in options and details. After spending a day looking up a variety of ways to create and host a website I settled on Github for a few reasons:

1. Open source and large community involvement.
2. I gain exposure to working with code.
3. I believe skills learned here will parlay into other areas of computer science I am interested in (data science, visualisations, open source involvement, transitioning to a remote working career)
