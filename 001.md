# 1. How do you create and host a tiny (simple) website?

## Intro
Starting out on this project it is easy to get bogged down in options and details. After spending a day looking up a variety of ways to create and host a website I started to get overwhelmed. After taking a break from the computer I settled on Github for a few reasons:

1. Open source and large community involvement.
2. I gain exposure to working with code.
3. I believe skills learned here will parlay into other areas of computer science I am interested in (data science, visualisations, open source involvement, transitioning to a remote working career)
4. I just needed to pick something and get started.

## Resources & Skills needed

### Resources
- Computer
- Internet connection
- Time

### Skills needed
- Github fluency
  - Repositories
  - Markdown
  - Styling and formatting files

## Process
Once I settled on using Github to start this project I didn't know where to start. I bounced around between a few websites and books detailing "how-to" and some of them seemed particularly helpful.

Part of my inspiration for this project comes from the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). I have found this book very helpful in my persuit of trying to learn data science from ground zero. Howerver the thing I kept thinking when reading the book is how ***clear and organized*** it is. The outline format is awesome. The interaction within the book and the web is seamless. And most of all I appreciated how simple and easy to use it is.

Lately I've been struggling to keep my thoughts organized and I've been flailing somewhat in trying to learn new things. I hope this process will help to close the gap on these two problems.

### Github Fluency
I first created an account with Github in early 2021. I had head of Github before and even browsed a few repositories in the past (admittedly, completely unaware of what I was looking at). I know it's a big deal in the open source community, however I have never really "understood" Github. I know that source code is stored on Github and that Git was the community standard for open-source versioning. I know people worked collectively on Github, but I don't know exactly ***how*** that works. [Here](https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/create-github-account.html) is a great explanation of what Github is by Daniel Kehoe.

To increase my Github fluency I need to:
- Work on creating this site
- Complete Github tutorials
- Read informative webistes

#### Work on creating this site
This is it, you're reading it.

#### Complete Github tutorials
[github-slideshow](https://github.com/verticalwhiteout/github-slideshow) is the bot-created repository in my Github account. Currently I haven't completed very much of it.

#### Read informative websites
There are quite a few helpful and inspirational sites that are available to me online:
- [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) (written for R Markdown, but helpful)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
