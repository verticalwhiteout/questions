# 1. How do you create and host a tiny (simple) website?

Starting out on this project it is easy to get bogged down in options and details. After spending a day looking up a variety of ways to create and host a website I started to get overwhelmed. After taking a break from the computer I settled on Github for a few reasons:

1. Open source and large community involvement.
2. I gain exposure to working with code.
3. I believe skills learned here will parlay into other areas of computer science I am interested in (data science, visualisations, open source involvement, transitioning to a remote working career)
4. I just needed to pick something and get started.

## Tools needed
- Computer
- Internet connection
- Time

## Skills needed
- Github fluency
  - Repositories
  - Markdown
  - Styling and formatting files

## Process
Once I settled on using Github to start this project I didn't know where to start. I bounced around between a few websites and books detailing "how-to" and some of them seemed particularly helpful.

Part of my inspiration for this project comes from the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). I have found this book very helpful in my persuit of trying to learn data science from ground zero. Howerver the thing I kept thinking when reading the book is how ***clear and organized*** it is. The outline format is awesome. The interaction within the book and the web is seamless. And most of all I appreciated how simple and easy to use it is.

Lately I've been struggling to keep my thoughts organized and I've been flailing somewhat in trying to learn new things. I hope this process will help to close the gap on these two problems.
